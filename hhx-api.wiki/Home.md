# The Hip Hop Xpress API ðŸŽ§ 
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ 

In the future, this wiki will be replacing the mess that is the [`README.md`](https://github.com/Hip-Hop-Xpress/hhx-api/blob/master/README.md) documentation. Right now, the wiki will be updated as features get implemented - the README will act as a guide and the Wiki will be more of a progress tracker.

The goal for the wiki is to have all information needed for using the API, including endpoints, structure of body requests/results, error codes, etc.

## Introduction

The Hip Hop Xpress API serves as a connection point between the physical lab and clients/users of the mobile app, as well as other related applications. It is built around REST and HTTP, using `POST`, `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` HTTP verbs. All response data will be returned as JSON.
